# Explanation:
# We are storing 20 in our computer's memory and
# attaching age as a label for this location
age = 20
# We are now printing value of age variable
# print(age)
# Note: We are not doing print("age").
# Reason: We will see Text Age on Screen. We do not want that.
# In Python, the program is executed from top to bottom
age = 30
print(age)
# more examples
# In python, we can numbers with decimal point or whole numbers
price = 19.95
# We can also declare a variable and assign a String value
# Best practices / Tip :
# - if we want to use multiple words in a variable, separate multiple words with "_" to make the code more readable
first_name = "Krishna"
# Boolean values can also be set, True or False (like Yes or No in english)
is_online = True
# Note : Python is a case-sensitive language, if you use true (lowercase) Instead of True, it will throw a error.
# False (with Capital F) / True (With Capital T) is a special keyword. They show the boolean value.
